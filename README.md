# 🧠 AI Agent Portfolio

Everyone’s talking about AI.

Most of what’s out there is either hype or half-baked.

This page isn’t about “changing the world with AI.” It’s about solving small, specific, simple problems that make work feel clunky, repetitive, or slower than it should be.

I’m Akshat. I build AI agents that change your world, not the world.

## 👋 About Me

I help brands position and launch in markets they haven’t experienced yet. Think new geographies, new categories, new audiences...

At Novo Nordisk, I’ve built global brand plans, shaped local marketing campaigns, and driven adoption for category-defining products (GLP-1s). I have also launched and scaled AI pilots across the org.

See, behind the decks and dashboards, I love tinkering. I’ve built agents that power internal tools, automate the boring bits, and help teams get to clarity faster. 

You’ll find a few below :)
